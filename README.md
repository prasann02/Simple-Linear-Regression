# Problem Statement: 1

A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company to find the relationship between a person’s weight gain and the number of calories they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for these individuals. Build a Simple Linear Regression model with calories consumed as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models. 

# Problem Statement: 2

A logistics company recorded the time taken for delivery and the time taken for the sorting of the items for delivery. Build a Simple Linear Regression model to find the relationship between delivery time and sorting time with delivery time as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.

# Problem Statement: 3
A certain organization wants an early estimate of their employee churn out rate. So the HR department gathered the data regarding the employee’s salary hike and the churn out rate in a financial year. The analytics team will have to perform an analysis and predict an estimate of employee churn based on the salary hike. Build a Simple Linear Regression model with churn out rate as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.

# Problem Statement: 4

The head of HR of a certain organization wants to automate their salary hike estimation. The organization consulted an analytics service provider and asked them to build a basic prediction model by providing them with a dataset that contains the data about the number of years of experience and the salary hike given accordingly. Build a Simple Linear Regression model with salary as the target variable. Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient values for different models.
